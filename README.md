# ArdWeKnow
(Firstyear project #1)

For our very first project of the computer engineering course we got to experience the true programming life, in which a few of our quotes were:
- 'Why isn't this working?!'
- 'So how does a shift register work again?'
- 'What you're saying is that I need to google the model number and find out how all the ports of the component are going to communicate with the Arduino?'
- 'When I connected this component the other stopped working and now I really want to cry'
- 'OMG IT IS WORKING!'
- 'Oh, now it isn't anymore'
- 'We tried to create a bit of uniformity with the sorted coloured jumpers, also because it looks way more fun, right?!'
- 'Maybe we should have soldered more'
- 'The button stopped working again. I'm so glad we didn't solder it!'
- 'Scrum actually could have been very handy, should we have followed the rules more'
- 'PLANNING POKER!!1!!1'
- 'My computer crashed again, can you create the Fritzing diagrams on your laptop?'

So at this point you're probably wondering what the project consisted of. Or not, but either way I'm going to tell you:

The assignment consisted of creating a simulation of an electric stove. The stove was controlled by an Arduino (for which we had to write code for in C) and had to include 8 pits with LED's (as the stoves); buttons for turning the complete stove off/on, activating the child-proof lock, and some for a self-decided way of controlling the stoves; 2 4-digit 7 segment displays, and 2 shift-registers. 

The biggest challenge I think was for our group to get acquainted with the programming and figuring out how the electronics work and communicate. This was also a project in which we learned what Scrum (and Agile) is, and got to implement it in the planning of the project. 

Also with this project I can proudly say that I was the one to come up with the group name: ArdWeKnow. I hope you realize it's a very genious (if I may so myself) play of words on Arduino. The name definitely made up for the lack of ArdWeKnowledge we had at the beginning of the project, and was a clear proof of our enthusiasm and determination in the first week. However, I really do think this project thought us a lot and gave us a good foundation of knowledge and a healthy amount of persistance, which I both find very important in a engineer.
